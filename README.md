# olp
One-liner Python

Execute arbitary python one-liners in the terminal

# installation
Clone the repo and run ```sh setup.sh```
If you don't want me messing around in your /usr/local/bin ofcourse, you can just use good old ```chmod +x olp``` and then ```export PATH=$PATH:path-to-repo```

# usage
```
olp "sum(range(10))"
45
```
